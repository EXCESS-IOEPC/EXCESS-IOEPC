							<p><strong>Learn about X-Tech Nepal is still too far behind developed countries, especially in technology and innovation, in
								this era of the rapidly evolving field of technology. To make an impact, improve technical
								proficiency and enhance student skills. EXCESS decided to hold an annual event called X-Tech. X-Tech is one of the best engineering tech festivals. X-Tech has offered a platform for
								electronics and tech students to compete, show off their skills, and learn. Workshops,
								competitions, and training such as IoT and Automation Workshops, Hardware Hackathon
								and Smart Digital Room competitions, Robotics Events and Project Demonstration were all
								part of X-Tech events. X-Tech is about more than just techies. Other activities include a
								presentation competition, quizzes, talk shows, personal development webinars,
								entertainment activities such as music and dance and many more.

						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>X-Tech intends to improve technical and non-technical skills essential in the industry. X-Tech has established a strong presence in Nepal's Eastern Region. Previously, technical
								events were limited to Kathmandu Valley. X-Tech significantly improved students' skills
								from IOE, Purwanchal Campus and other institutes. X-Tech was required to promote
								technical and non-technical skills for all students. X-Tech vision is to build a better and
								more effective platform for all students in the technical field. X-tech assists students in
								becoming industry and corporate-ready. X-Tech helps students to excel in the technical and
								non-technical areas through competitions, workshops and events</strong></p>
